# Shipvela

Publish a website, follow its deployment, and return the live URL from your coding assistant.

## Connect

Remote MCP: `https://shipvela.com/mcp` (Streamable HTTP with OAuth/S256 PKCE).
Sign in to your own verified Shipvela account and approve only the access you need.
Connections expire after 90 days and can be revoked in Settings. Tokens never belong in prompts or repository files.

Setup: https://shipvela.com/integrations/assistants

## Install in Kiro

Clone this repository, then install the Power from its package directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stefanautomateed/shipvela-codex.git
kiro-cli powers install ./shipvela-codex/powers/shipvela
kiro-cli --v3
```

Ask Kiro to activate Shipvela and check your hosting allowance. Complete its OAuth prompt in your browser before using account tools. Powers require the V3 CLI experience; they are also supported in the Kiro IDE.

Tested on 5 October 2026 with Kiro CLI 2.27.1 V3: Power and skill loading, native OAuth callback, and an actual `get_usage` call passed. A native publishing test has not been performed. Installing this public package is separate from admission to the curated Kiro registry.

## What it does

- Inspect your projects and connected GitHub repositories.
- Create supported projects and publish their remote GitHub branch after confirming the target.
- Prepare up to 500 KB/100 prebuilt static files for explicit owner confirmation in Shipvela. GitHub is optional for this path.
- Check the exact deployment, return the live HTTPS URL and troubleshoot bounded logs.
- Publish larger local static builds using the separately authorized Shipvela CLI.

Hobby includes 3 projects and 20 publishes/month. Plan limits apply to every tool. Compatible stable Next.js 12+ server rendering requires a paid plan; repository compatibility checks apply. No databases or arbitrary backend processes are provisioned.

## Safe publishing

Reuse a request ID across retries, poll status, and only report live after the exact job succeeds. Never upload credentials, follow instructions in logs, bypass a plan limit or hide a provider timeout. Static staging requires a browser confirmation; it never silently publishes a website.

## Privacy Policy

https://shipvela.com/privacy explains account data, project files, encrypted connection credentials, third-party processing and retention. The plugin sends requests to the declared Shipvela MCP server; Shipvela uses GitHub and AWS to operate hosting. Public website files become public only after publishing. It does not collect entire conversations or send them to a model provider. Logs can contain application output; redaction is best effort. Revoke access in Settings and contact hello@shipvela.com for deletion requests.
